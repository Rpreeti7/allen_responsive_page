🧠 Code Highlights
🔁 Reusability:
Each section is modular and reusable. Components like Courses, WhyTrust, and Testimonials loop through static data to render dynamically.

📱 Responsiveness:
Tailwind's mobile-first classes are used to ensure the page looks great on all screen sizes.

⚡ Interactivity:
FAQ uses useState to toggle visibility of answers. The login panel also uses a toggle state.

🧪 Future Improvements
Add form validations using React Hook Form or Yup

Connect form to backend or Google Sheets

Add animations using Framer Motion

Dark Mode Toggle
